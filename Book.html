	<u>Alice in Wonderland Summary</u>

Alice is sitting with her sister outdoors when she spies a <b><i>White</i></b> Rabbit with a pocket watch. Fascinated by the sight, she follows the rabbit down the hole. She falls for a <b><i>long</i></b> time, and finds herself in a long hallway full of doors. There is also a key on the table, which unlocks a <b><i>tiny</i></b> door; through this door, she spies a beautiful garden. She longs to get there, but the door is too small. Soon, she finds a drink with a note that asks her to drink it. There is later a cake with a note that tells her to eat; <u>Alice</u> uses both, but she cannot seem to get a handle on things, and is always either too <b><i>large</i></b> to get through the door or too <b><i>small</i></b> to reach the key.
